# Overview
This is a facial recognition software that uses OpenCV to detect whether a human face is present before the camera or not. 
It has the capacity to recognize most faces, but requires that the user has OpenCV downloaded onto their local machine, and
the path for certain files manually entered into the program itself, so that they can be included.

This program was written as a practice for device integration with software, as a means to understand how to access a device
through the code, and give it commands.

# Development Environment
This program was written using VSCode.

It was written in C++, and uses OpenCV hpp's.

# Future Work
- Adding integration with other devices, such as a phone, in order to use with lock screen, or as a video chat monitor.
- Change of programming language, to integrate with more modern support.
- Means to include necessary OpenCV components in download.
